## Reflective Analysis

The goal of this map was to clearly indicate catchment areas for the 3 major public secondary schools in the South Surrey/White Rock area. The target audience is families currently residing in the area or are planning on moving into the area and who have children entering secondary school. The primary target is for families who already live in the area and wish to know which high school their children will graduate into. The information was presented very clearly and simply using vector polygons overlaid on a basic street map. The polygons were coloured appropriately to indicate which areas belonged to which school and assigned a 0.3 opacity to still allow for visibility of the underlying base map. Additionally, colours selected were meant to be clear and distinct but not overbearing to the point that the polygon may obscure important underlying information. Data for catchment area delineation was taken from the Surrey School District (SD36). In liu of a legend, a point layer was added that indicated the positions of each school of interest as labeled icons. The labels were given a white outline and black text to stand out against the coloured background.

There are two major ways that the map could be improved. The first would be by finding a method to make the polygons flush with each other for a more organized visual presentation. At smaller scales, the issue of messy borders is less relevant because the areas are quite small, but when zoomed in, some areas may be misclassified or not classified at all. The second improvement would be by adding elementary schools as points to make it even more clear to families which secondary school is most appropriate for them. This addition would be especially useful for families whose primary language may not be English and rely on familiar terms such as names and visual cues.

### Note

Unfortunately, I was unable to have a map critique session, so any feedback is more than welcome!
